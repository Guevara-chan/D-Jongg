##/Sum/:
**D-Jongg** is an experimental 3D puzzle game, written in ~3 days as self-imposed challenge. It entrusts player with rather important task of dismantling giant space cube by removing matching pairs. Mostly reported as casual.  

##/Featurae/:
-	Shader-powered visual FX to make your body ready.
-	Three-state playfield volume selector to test your spirit.
-	Scientifically-correct cosmic silence to enlighten your mind.
-	XCopy-based installation. Just because I support that concept so hard.

##/Requirements (tested)/:
**Proc. Unit >=** Pentium 4, 2.0GHz  
**R.A.M. >=** 2.0GB  
**Hard Drive >=** 6MB  
**GCard:** Radeon 9550+

## /Reassembling/:
**SlipperyClip** is written completely in PureBasic v4.40, though compatible with v5.30.  
It relies on Xors3D abandonware engine, which is bundled as pre-patched DLL.  
To compile project use 'Main.pb' as root sourcefile.
