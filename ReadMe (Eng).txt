F.A.Q.:
Q: Why there are no sound in game ? 
A: It takes action in open space). 

Q: Why there are no musical accompaniment ? 
A: For the simple reason that something more worthy than some 8-bit beeping looped in one minute will take more space in archive than rest of the game. At this moment I find such things too wasteful. 

Q: Why cube can't be rotated vertically ? 
A: As you can see, this feature is already supported in source code, yet due to confusing effect on player it was temporarily disabled for indefinite period. 

Q: I can't get the rules!!!11one
A: Unable to help you, sorry. 

Q: What actually this game downloads after receiving from user agreement for updating DirectX ?
A: "Lite" version of official installer: http://latest.xors3d.com/dxredist.exe^W http://file1.softsea.com/Driver_Update/dxwebsetup.exe

Q: Why you not just distribute game with all necessary things ? 
A: Thank MicroSoft - their EULA restrict me from adding required DLL directly in the archive.

Q: What means "WARNING: NO PS 2.0 SUPPORT FOUND" message ?
A: Apparently your video card just doesn't provide support for required version (2.0) of pixel shaders. Well, if it sure isn't so - contact me for the further investigation of this problem (EMail would be given further).

Q: How distribution type of this project corresponding with the propertiary license of Xors3D ? 
A: It's just same situation as with a similar license for PB's compiler: although resulting product are free to end users, any developer who wish to utilize attached sources will have to solve all questions with rights for using corresponding software by themselves. Well, in the case that you really have something worthy to offer - just contact me. 

Q: How can I contact the author (you) ?
