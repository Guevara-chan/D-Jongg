Rules: similar to ones in most of solitaire Mah-jonggs, yet with some adjustments for tridimensionality. The goal is to completely clean playing field by pairwise elimination of dices, exposed from at least one side by abscissa and applicate axises simultaneously.


Controls:
Esc - Quit game.
TAB - Minimize game to tray.
LMB - Select dice/Remove pair.
RMB - Cancel selection.
BackSpace - Undo last action.
Left/Right or A/D - Camera rotation.
MMB (when moving cursor) - Camera rotation.
Space - Darken unselectable dicez.


F.A.Q.:
Q: Why there are no sound in game ? 
A: It takes action in open space. 

Q: Why there are no musical accompaniment ? 
A: For one simple reason that something more worthy than 8-bit beeping looped in one minute will take more space in archive than actual game. So far I found such things rather wasteful. 

Q: Why cube can't be rotated vertically ? 
A: As you can see, this feature is already supported in source code, yet due to confusing effect on player it was temporarily disabled for indefinite period. 

Q: I can't get the rules!!!11one
A: Unable to help you, sorry. 

Q: What actually this game downloads after receiving user's agreement about updating DirectX ?
A: Repacked in Zip content from June 2010 End-User: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109 . In case you wish to download and install by yourself - just do it.

Q: How about distributing game with all necessary things bundled together ? 
A: Thank Microsoft here - their EULA restrict me from including required DLLs directly to archive.

Q: What means "WARNING: NO PS 2.0 SUPPORT FOUND" message ?
A: Apparently your video card just doesn't provide support for required version (2.0) of pixel shaders. That being said, if it's not really a case - just contact me for some further investigation.

Q: How distribution type of this project corresponding with the propertiary license of Xors3D ? 
A: It's kind of same situation as with a similar license for PB's compiler: while resulting product are free for end users, any developers who wish to use porovided sources is supposed to solve all issues with copyrighted software by themselves.

Q: How can I contact the author (you) ? 
A: Guevara-chan[@]Mail[dot]RU
