Rules: pretty similar to ones in mojoire of solitaire Mah-jonggs, yet with some adjustments for tridimensionality. The goal is to completely clean playing field by pairwise elimination of dices, exposed from at least one side by abscissa and applicate axises simultaneously.


Controls:
Esc - Quit game.
TAB - Minimize game to tray.
LMB - Select dice/Remove pair.
RMB - Cancel selection.
BackSpace - Undo last action.
Left/Right or A/D - Camera rotation.
MMB (when moving cursor) - Camera rotation.
Space - Darken unselectable dicez.


F.A.Q.:
Q: Why there are no sound in game ? 
A: It takes action in open space. 

Q: Why there are no musical accompaniment ? 
A: For the simple reason that something more worthy than some 8-bit beeping looped in one minute will take more space in archive than rest of the game. At gived moment I find those things just too wasteful. 

Q: Why there is no vertical rotation for cube  ? 
A: As you probably can see, this feature was already somewhat implemented in source code, though temporary disabled due to confusing effect on player until better implementation.

Q: I can't get those rules!!!11one
A: Unable to help you, sorry. 

Q: What actually this game downloads after receiving user's agreement about updating DirectX ?
A: Latest DX9 redist from MS: http://download.microsoft.com/download/8/4/A/84A35BF1-DAFE-4AE8-82AF-AD2AE20B6B14/directx_Jun2010_redist.exe

Q: How about distributing game with all necessary things bundled together ? 
A: Thank MicroSoft - it's their EULA restricts me from adding required DLL directly to archive.

Q: What means "WARNING: NO PS 2.0 SUPPORT FOUND" message ?
A: Apparently your video card just doesn't cut it for required version (2.0) of pixel shaders. That being said, if it's not really so - try contacting me for the further investigation.

Q: How distribution type of this project corresponding with the propertiary license of Xors3D ? 
A: It's kind of same situation as with a similar license for PB's compiler: although resulting product are free to end users, any developer who wish to utilize attached sources forced to solve all questions with rights for using corresponding software by themselves. Well, in the case that you really have something worthy to offer - just contact me. 

Q: How can I contact the author (you) ? 
A: Guevara-chan[@]Mail[dot]RU
